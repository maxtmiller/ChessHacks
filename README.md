# **AlphaPoisson**

AlphaPoisson is a collection of self-trained AI chess engines developed during **ChessHacks 2025** by our team *Échec et mat du poisson*. Our goal was to explore how far lightweight, custom-trained models can go using a mix of self-play, handcrafted evaluation heuristics, and iterative refinement.

---

## 🚀 Overview

AlphaPoisson features multiple chess engines trained under different configurations, each with its own style and strengths.  
You can play against them directly on our website or explore the source code to see how each engine was built.

Key ideas behind the project include:

- **Self-play training loops**
- **Custom evaluation functions**
- **Iterative parameter tuning**
- **Search techniques (minimax, alpha-beta pruning, etc.)**
- **Lightweight model experimentation within hackathon constraints**

## 🌐 Play Online

Play against the AlphaPoisson engines in your browser:

👉 *(Will update with live website)*

Each engine offers a different play style — from aggressive tactical play to slower positional strategy.
